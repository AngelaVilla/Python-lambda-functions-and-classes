# Python-lambda-functions-and-classes
## creator: Angela Villasanta
Hello world! This is my first repository. I am sharing to you an old assignment submission for my Python class.

These are 5 separate exercises, each written out in markdown cells / text not in code. Each one is followed by my own solution, written in a code cell.

They are about as follows:
  1. Using a lambda expression to perform multiplication
  2. Importing math module
  3. Building a simple calculator using 1 function
  4. Define a class named Rectangle (computes the area)
  5. Define a superclass named Shape and a subclass named Square (computes the area of a square and identifies the shape)
  
  That is all. Thank you.
